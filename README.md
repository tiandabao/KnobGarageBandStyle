KnobGarageBandStyle
=============================

I have managed to finish garage band style Knob and the repo has been updated. Please feel free to download it and extend it. I hope it's more optimised version. The difference between previous project and this project is,

- Previous project was AWFUL!!! I didn't put much effort as I was in my learning stage.
- This project I have learnt tricks from my university as well as web resources such as, { http://blog.mellenthin.de/archives/2012/02/13/an-one-finger-rotation-gesture-recognizer/ }

> Note :

- The tutorial is a great start to know the Math and all the tricks. However the Knob I have pushed to the repo is more restrictive. The project in above link has a knob which continuously spins. But I wanted a Knob which goes from MIN to MAX. Please feel free to change this interaction style if you want.

Addition
==========
After completing the knob rotation, I thought, I should make use of this knob. So, I created curtains as normal UIImageView and changing the mid point of that UIImageView based on how much rotation is being made. There are some mathematical glitches, I will solved it in my future commits. 

Enjoy!
